# Instructions

If you'd like to build the model youself:

1. Download the dataset from each congress term, and unzip them all into the data folder, like so:
   <img src="data_display.png" alt="Alt Text" width="120" height="100">
2. Run run.py with argument --preprocessing_dir to the preprocessing directory that you'd like. Likely, it will be something like outputs/preprocess
   xs
